# Oxygen Workers Types

This package provides TypeScript definitions for the Oxygen runtime by Shopify.

It is a derivative of [`@cloudflare/workers-types`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-types).

## Development

See the [development page](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Usage

The following is a minimal `tsconfig.json` for use alongside this package:

**`tsconfig.json`**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "types": ["@shopify/oxygen-workers-types"]
  }
}
```

To view the Typedoc-generated documentation, navigate to the docs folder within the `node_modules/@shopify/oxygen-workers-types` directory after installation, and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

This package exposes different entrypoints for supported "compatibility date" on the Oxygen platform. Each entrypoint is available to import under its respective date, e.g. `@shopify/oxygen-workers-types/2022-10-31`. You can review available entrypoints in the aforementioned typedoc-generated documentation.
