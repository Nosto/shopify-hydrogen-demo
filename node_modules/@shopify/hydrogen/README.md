Hydrogen is Shopify’s stack for headless commerce. It provides a set of tools, utilities, and best-in-class examples for building dynamic and performant commerce applications. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full stack web framework, but it also provides a React library portable to other supporting frameworks.

**Create a Hydrogen app**

```bash
npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
```
